The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org), also known as EFF, couldn't have said it any better than I can:
> Including [embeds] on your website creates some privacy risk, allowing the party that hosts the [content] to record information about your visitors and place cookies in their browser. This usually happens as soon as a visitor loads a webpage [...]

Curtain limits the privacy risks of embeds in various ways. While this can be compared to EFF's [MyTube](https://www.eff.org/pages/mytube-limit-privacy-risks-embedded-video), [it does have some differences](https://github.com/jbmagination/Curtain/blob/main/MYTUBE.md).
